testresources release notes
---------------------------

IN DEVELOPMENT
--------------

0.2.5
-----

IMPROVEMENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added ``testresources.FixtureResource`` to wrap ``fixtures.Fixture``
  instances. (Robert Collins)

* super() is now called from ResourcedTestCase fixing a long standing issue
  with using it as a mix-in in Python 2.4 and above. (Tim Cole, #771505)

* Typo in NEWS fixed. (Thommi Richards)

0.2.4
-----

CHANGES
~~~~~~~

* Relicenced to BSD / Apache2.0 with full agreement of contributors.

IMPROVEMENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Substantially improved documentation in README. (mbp)

* Rename TestResource to TestResourceManager leaving TestResource as an alias.
  Fixes bug #520769.

* Test sorting no longer performs N! work on tests that can never benefit from
  order optimisations (when resources are not shared an arbitrary order is
  sufficient). Partial fix for bug #522338.

* Test sorting now uses a heuristic on each partition to get a sort that is
  no worse than twice the optimal number of setup/teardown operations and is
  fast to calculate. Fixes bug #522338

0.2.3
-----

CHANGES
~~~~~~~

IMPROVEMENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Distribute doc/*.py in the source tarball.

* New helper testresources.GenericResource which should remove the need for
  much boilerplate when using testresources with existing test fixtures.

BUG FIXES
~~~~~~~~~

API CHANGES
~~~~~~~~~~~

* New public functions testresources.setUpResources and
  testresources.tearDownResources for folk that cannot easily use
  ResourcedTestCase. Fixes bug #504146.

INTERNALS
~~~~~~~~~

0.2.2
-----

BUG FIXES
~~~~~~~~~

* OptimisingTestSuite.addTest was not unpacking OptimisingTestSuite instances.
  When using testresources.TestLoader to load tests this was generating an
  unoptimised layout, with each test in its own little suite, and no resource
  sharing happening.

0.2.1
------

A small bugfix release for compatibility with newer testtools.

INTERNALS
~~~~~~~~~

* One test case wasn't upcalling setUp properly, causing test failures with
  more recent testtools that check for this mistake.

0.2
---

  CHANGES:

    * testresources needs testtools to run the testresources test suite. You
      can still use testresources without using testtools. (Jonathan Lange)

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Many more docstrings. (Jonathan Lange)

    * Expanded README. (Jonathan Lange)

    * Expanded TODO. (Jonathan Lange)

    * Resources can now be reset by overriding TestResource.reset, which for
      some resources is significantly cheaper. If checking for dirtiness is
      expensive, isDirty can also be overridden.
      (James Henstridge, Robert Collins)

    * Started keeping a NEWS file! (Jonathan Lange)

    * Resource creation and destruction are traced by calling methods on the
      TestResult object that tests are being run with.
      (Robert Collins, #284125)

  BUG FIXES:

    * Calling getResource on a dirty resource now triggers a clean and re-make
      of that resource. (Jonathan Lange)

    * All resources are dropped when a test with no declared resources is run.
      (James Henstridge)

    * A dirty or changed dependency of a resource makes the resource dirty too.
      (Robert Collins, #324202)

  API CHANGES:

    * adsorbSuite is now deprecated in favour of addTest. addTest now flattens
      standard library TestSuites and distributes custom TestSuite across
      their member tests. (Jonathan Lange)

    * ResourcedTestCase.setUpResources and tearDownResources are now instance
      methods, not static methods. (Jonathan Lange)

    * All methods on TestResource are now instance methods, and thus tests
      should use instances of TestResource subclasses, not the classes
      themselves. (Jonathan Lange)

    * Now imports from testtools rather than pyunit3k. (Jonathan Lange)

    * ResourcedTestCase will now look for resources in the 'resources'
      attribute, rather than the '_resources' attribute. (Jonathan Lange)

    * ResourcedTestCase.setUpResources and tearDownResources are now instance
      methods, not static methods. (Jonathan Lange)

    * SampleTestResource has been removed. (Jonathan Lange)

    * TestResource.make has had an API change: it must now accept a
      dependency_resources parameter which is a dictionary listing the
      dependencies that will be provided to the resource. This parameter is
      provided so the resource can access its dependencies during setUp, if
      needed. (Robert Collins)

    * TestResource subclasses should override 'make' and 'clean' where they
      previously overrode '_makeResource' and '_cleanResource'.
      (Jonathan Lange)

    * TestResource.setResource has been renamed to _setResource.
      (Jonathan Lange)

  INTERNALS:

    * A lot of the tests have been split up into smaller tests. Others have
      been refactored. (Jonathan Lange)

    * If calling finishedWith on a TestResource reduces its usage count to
      zero, then the TestResource considers itself clean, i.e. _dirty is set
      to True. (Jonathan Lange)

    * OptimisingTestSuite has been refactored internally so that the way we
      switch active resources and determine the cost of switching is more
      obvious. (Jonathan Lange)
